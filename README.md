# Persistence Filter

The **Persistence Filter** is an efficient Bayesian algorithm for estimating a belief over the continued existence of environmental features, a common problem arising in robotic mapping in semi-static (i.e., *changing*) environments.

We are making this software freely available in the hope that it will be useful to others.  If you use the Persistence Filter in your own work, please cite our [paper](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/publication/persistencefilter-icra/PersistenceFilter-ICRA.pdf):
